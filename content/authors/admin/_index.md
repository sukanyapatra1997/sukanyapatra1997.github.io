## About Me

Sukanya Patra is a PhD candidate at the [Big Data and Machine Learning Lab](https://web.umons.ac.be/bdml/en/home/) at the University of Mons advised by [Souhaib Ben Taieb](https://www.souhaib-bentaieb.com/). Her research interests lie in exploring the theory of deep learning and its applications, focusing on problems related to image data. Presently, her research is centred around deep anomaly detection. Her work focuses on developing novel anomaly detection methods that can address some of the most challenging aspects of industrial applications, which include tackling non-stationarity in data and working with limited, weak labels. Prior to the current position, she received a Master's degree in Data Science from the Eindhoven University of Technology.
